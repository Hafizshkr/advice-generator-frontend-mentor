 Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app solution

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge I encountered in this project was how to fetch the API, manage the data, and display it. Additionally, I added a loading feature.
